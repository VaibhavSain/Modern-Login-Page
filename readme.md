        The login page is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

    Stylish UI:
        Utilizing modern CSS techniques, the login page features a clean and visually appealing design. This includes smooth transitions, minimalistic elements, and a contemporary color scheme.

    Interactive Elements:
        JavaScript enhances user interaction by validating input fields, providing real-time feedback, and managing form submissions without page reloads.

    CSS: Advanced styling techniques, including Flexbox/Grid, transitions, and media queries for responsiveness.
    JavaScript: Form validation, interactive elements, and potential integration with back-end services (e.g., authentication APIs).

Next Steps:
